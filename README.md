# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio aimed at showcasing my coding skills. I graduated from Code Institute on a Full Stack Web Development course and achieved a Diploma in Software Development. I completed four separate projects, with Code Institute, using a variety of frontend and backend coding languages, frameworks and libraries. Such include but are not limited to: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Python, Django, Flask, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Materialize, etc.

## Brief overview of Code Institute's projects:

### BusyBakes: Project 1

The first project was a static website that shows my ability to utilise HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. The aim of this project was to create a website for users to sign up for baking lessons, after browsing through and selecting the classes they wished to attend.

### Sadie’s Zoo: Project 2

The second project was a memory card game. The aim of this game was to provide users with a simple game for them to play to help time pass by. The project focussed on the use of Javascript and jQuery, as well as HTML5 and CSS3.

### Cinemagic: Project 3

The third project was a movie ticket booking site. The aim of this project was to enable users the ability to browse through a series of movies displayed on the site, then create accounts to book the tickets they wanted. This project made use of CRUD functionality, allowing users to create accounts for booking tickets, read their created bookings, update their bookings when changing the ticket quantity or selected movie and delete bookings when no longer desired. The project used Python with Flask, MongoDB, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery and Materialize.

### Slurps: Project 4

The fourth project was an online drink shop, selling juices and milkshakes. The aim of this project was for users to buy the drinks offered on the site. Users could also utilise the CRUD functionality made available by creating accounts to keep record of their orders, reading their drink orders, updating their orders when making changes to them and deleting their orders if no longer interested. The project used Python with Django, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap.
